	"coreStatement": "In this cutthroat game, loyalty is a liability, trust is a luxury, and only the cunning master manipulators emerge victorious",
	"gameInspiration": "This game idea originated from Samuel Jenâ€™s board game concept, drawing inspiration from his favourite board game genre: social deception games. He was particularly influenced by games such as Coup and One Night Ultimate Werewolf, where players must employ deception to achieve victory. These games are characterised by bluffing, strategic thinking, and betrayal. Expanding upon these fundamental concepts, our team developed Knights and Knaves, which takes chaos and backstabbing to new heights. We also drew inspiration from Gwent for our game card design. Last but not least, our story unfolds in mediaeval times, where mystical wonders and imaginative realms know no bounds. Tino Ciccone drew inspiration from The Hobbit to shape our background narrative, infusing it with adventure and intrigue.",

		"text3": "When the number of players is not divisible by 3, certain teams may find themselves with fewer members.

		"text12": "As the game progresses, players engage in fewer discussions as everyone becomes familiar with each other's identities. Paired with the shrinking deck size, this leads to a decrease in the average turn time, starting at 40 seconds in the early stages and dwindling to 20 seconds or even less at the end.",
		"title2": "Playtesting Insights",
		"text21": "The outcomes from our playtesting sessions are as follows:",
		"text22": "The initial playthrough lasted longer than subsequent ones, as it was the team's first attempt at the game, and we were still grasping the nuances of the rules. It's worth noting that sessions, where players refrain from collaborating with their teammates, tend to take significantly longer to complete, primarily due to the limited number of attacking cards and the time it takes to find the remaining ones in the deck. In games where players strategise with their teammates, it becomes easier to identify targets, and players are less likely to squander attacking cards unnecessarily.",

		"header": "Unlocking the equations behind every move!",
		"description":"Our quantitative analysis of Knights and Knaves aims to provide insights into the game's balance, probabilities, and design factors. We have conducted thorough playtesting and analysis to ensure fair and engaging gameplay for our players.",
		"title1": "Probabilistic Design Factors",
		"text11": "The game's design factors are inherently probabilistic, ensuring a dynamic and balanced gameplay experience. With a total of 75 action cards divided into basic and special categories, players are presented with a diverse array of offensive and defensive capabilities. Notably, the abundance of Shield cards among the basic set fosters strategic decision-making by offering ample defensive opportunities. Each player starts the game with 5 health points, while card distributions, influenced by effects like Arrow/Sword Strike and Knight's Potion, introduce strategic depth and prevent swift individual dominance. This balance ensures that no single player can quickly overpower others, promoting a more engaging and competitive environment.",
		"text12": "Considering the probabilities ingrained in the game mechanics is crucial for understanding potential outcomes and guiding strategic choices. The total maximum health on the board is determined by multiplying the number of players by 5 and adding 5 due to the effect of the Alliance card. Analysing offensive potential, factors such as Arrow/Sword Strike, Potion, and Jousting come into play, while defensive capabilities encompass Shield and Jousting/Shield combinations. Consequently, the maximum damage that can be dealt is capped at 25 health points, assuming optimal dice rolls for the attacker, and 5 health points, assuming optimal dice rolls for the defender. Given that games typically involve four or more players, it's improbable for a sole survivor to emerge, shifting the primary objective towards fostering teamwork and alliances for collective victory.",
		"text13":"The utilisation of dice in Jousting introduces an element of chance, adding an additional layer of complexity to strategic decision-making. When a tie occurs in Jousting, the challenger, who expends a card to initiate the action, gains no advantage, underscoring the importance of timing and resource management. Through a calculation of probabilities, it becomes evident that the challenger's chances of winning are slightly lower than those of the challengee (575 to 721), reinforcing the need for players to strategically coordinate to maximise their advantages. This aspect injects tension and excitement into the gameplay as players must carefully assess risks and opportunities to outmanoeuvre their opponents effectively.",
		"text14":"Incorporating a secrecy element adds an additional dimension to the game, introducing uncertainty regarding players' team identities. This imperfect information necessitates keen deduction skills and strategic thinking as players navigate through the ambiguity, considering potential bluffs and alliances. Ultimately, the combination of probabilistic design elements, strategic depth, and the secrecy aspect ensures a captivating and immersive gaming experience where players must employ wit, cunning, and cooperation to emerge victorious.",
		"title2": "Quantitative Insights from Playtesting",
		"text21":"Through extensive playtesting, we observed that a typical game lasts approximately some-some minutes, depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the rules. This duration strikes a balance between providing engaging gameplay and respecting players' time constraints.",
		"text22":"On average, players take approximately 30 seconds per turn, ensuring a smooth flow of gameplay without prolonged downtime. This time frame allows for strategic decision-making while maintaining the game's pace.",
		"text23":"The rate of player elimination varies based on strategic choices and card interactions. However, we ensured that elimination occurs gradually rather than abruptly, allowing eliminated players to remain engaged through observing the remaining gameplay.",
		"title3": "Quantitative Adjustments",
		"text3": "Based on playtesting feedback and quantitative analysis, we have identified several areas for improvement in Knights and Knaves. Here are the quantitative adjustments we have made to enhance gameplay balance and dynamics.",
		"title4": "Balancing Offensive and Defensive Cards",
		"text41": "To address the overabundance of defensive cards, particularly Shield cards, we have adjusted the distribution of basic cards.",
		"text42": "We reduced the number of Shield cards from 15 to 10, promoting a more balanced mix of offensive and defensive strategies.",
		"title5": "Enhancing Risk-Reward Mechanics",
		"text51": "To mitigate the repetitive use of defensive tactics like redirecting attacks to Jousting, we have introduced enhanced penalties for players who rely excessively on defensive manoeuvres.",
		"text52": "Players who lose a Jousting conflict after redirecting attacks will now receive an additional damage, further incentivising strategic diversity and risk assessment.",
		"title6": "Health Points Adjustment",
		"text61": "Players now begin the game with 7 health points instead of the previous 5, offering a robust buffer against early elimination and fostering prolonged, more dynamic gameplay experiences. This adjustment not only bolsters individual resilience but also underscores the significance of teamwork, compelling players to prioritise cooperation and strategic coordination over indiscriminate attacks on opponents.",
		"text62": "With the introduction of penalties that amplify damage, the expanded health pool provides players with the freedom to explore and experiment with new mechanics without the looming threat of premature elimination. This enhanced durability encourages players to take calculated risks, fostering a more adventurous and innovative approach to gameplay dynamics.",
		"title7": "Refinement of Special Card Effects",
		"text71": "Based on quantitative analysis of special card usage and impact, we have fine-tuned the effects of certain cards to ensure their strategic relevance.",
		"text72": "The adjustment to the Knight's Potion card, now requiring two Shields for block it instead of one, notably heightens its strategic significance. This change increases the potential damage it can inflict during gameplay, raising the stakes for players and adding depth to tactical planning.",
		"title8": "Strategic Depth and Player Interaction",
		"text81": "We have introduced additional rules to encourage strategic depth and player interaction, particularly regarding team identity bluffing.",
		"text82": "Players can now check their identity only once at the start of the game, highlighting the crucial roles of deduction, strategic deception, and resource management of the King's Intel card throughout gameplay."
