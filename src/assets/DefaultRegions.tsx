Formerly a realm of harmony and prosperity where royalty and commoners coexisted in unity, it has been ravaged by the civil war following King Aldric III’s mysterious death. The kingdom’s cities, once bustling with life, now bear the marks of turmoil and strife. Despite the devastation, the people of Estoria remain resolute in their determination to restore their land to its former glory. As factions vie for dominance and the echoes of past grandeur fade, the citizens are steadfast, driven by a shared resolve to rebuild their fractured home and reclaim the stability they once knew."),

This ancient woodland, the cradle of Estoria's foundation and the site of the fateful Night of Knives, has been ravaged by the civil war. The once-vibrant glades and towering trees are now marred by the scars of battle. Former allies have turned against each other, and the air is thick with the remnants of shattered loyalties and dark sorcery. As the forest's magic fades and its natural beauty is overshadowed by the chaos, the struggle for control of the region intensifies. The Feywild Forest, though still echoing with the whispers of its mystical past, is now a treacherous terrain where the struggle for power plays out amidst its wounded splendour.")
